						<h3>TRAVIA</h3>
						<p>Prior to its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis's daughter, 
							praised the film in an Instagram post after seeing it twice, calling it "nothing short of 
							spectacular". On Luhrmann's direction, she wrote that "your utter genius combined with your 
							love and respect for my father and this project is just so beautiful and so inspiring. I know 
							I'm being repetitive, but I don't care, Thank you for setting the record straight in such a 
							deeply profound and artistic way." </p>
